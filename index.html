<title>Could this be enough?</title>

<span><h2><a href='https://github.com/SvenDowideit/pages/issues/2'>OMG I rely on Docker so much, and yet, its still dissapointing</a> 34 minutes ago</h2><div>I got a new Thinkpad last week - an X1 Carbon gen7.

I install Ubuntu 20.04 on it, and was working remotely sshed / vscode remoted
to my work desktop, so didn't install more than the minimum.

This (long) weekend, I thought I'd see if there was a way that I could
manage my thoughts better - and everything I tryed wanted Docker installed

BUT ... `curl https://get.docker.com | bash` fails ... it seems Docker hasn't
their releases sorted......

mild meh - I kinda think I did enough to help Docker adoption.</div></span>
<span><h2><a href='https://github.com/SvenDowideit/pages/issues/1'>Ideas</a> 3 hours ago</h2><div>If I could find a place to write down ideas, and publish stuff i've found that's more convenient than twiki was, and just works

so far, i havn't found anything

but maybe github actions could make it work?</div></span>
